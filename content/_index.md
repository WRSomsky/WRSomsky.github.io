Welcome to **A Turn for the WRS**
--- a place for me, WRSomsky,
to have my turn to talk about those things
that I wish to share with the world.
Topics may range
from Linux administration to computer gaming;
from theoretical physics to recreational mathematics;
from Marvel movies to truly execrable puns.
As case in point for the latter:
the site title is meant to be pronounced *"A Turn for the Worse"*.
