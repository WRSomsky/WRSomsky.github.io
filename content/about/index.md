## About Me

My background is in theoretical physics,
with a Ph.D. from Princeton University
where I worked on computational particle physics.

For the past thirty years,
I have been
a Senior Computer Specialist
and the Linux Guru for 
the Physics and Astronomy departments
at the University of Washington (Seattle),
entrusted with the care and feeding
of the departments' Unix/Linux workstations and servers.

## Site Mechanics

This site -- as evidenced by the URL -- is hosted on GitHub Pages,
and is built with the Hugo static site generator
using the Mainroad theme with a liberal amount of tweaking.

## The Site Logo

The site logo depicts
a planetary gear system w/ an offset sun gear
that nonetheless still meshes and turns perfectly.
Puzzlemaker Oskar van Deventer
([Web](https://oskarvandeventer.nl/),
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@OskarPuzzle))
was able to 3D-print and post to YouTube
such an eccentric planetary system with three planetary gears,
calling them "[Looney Gears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKneWbgPz8E)",
but expressed doubt that any such configuration could be mathematically exact.
This intrigued me, and after some work,
I found that there were whole hosts of
mathematically exact configurations.
After I relayed this information to Oskar,
along w/ notes as to some possible configurations,
he then proceded to produce
a new eccentric planetary system with four planetary gears,
which he dubbed "[Somsky Gears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_BUn4TDns8)".
The logo is a depiction of that planetary gear set.
